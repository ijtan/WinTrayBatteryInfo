## Disclaimer
This tool is in early development. It is not intended to be used in anything serious.
## General Information
This tool is used to display battery status in a tray icon.  
Where several other metrics can be shown including:


- Battery Percentage
- Estimated Battery Time Remaining
- Charging status
- Current Charge / Discharge rate
- Battery Voltage
- Remaining Battery Capacity
- Battery Design Capacity       (WIP: does not work on all systems)
- Battery Health                (Does not work when Design Capacity is not available)
- Battery Temperature           (WIP: not yet implemented)

# Dynamic Tray Icons
Eventually, this should be customizable where a user can choose which metrics to display through a simple GUI, currently, preset metrics are shown, so the Icon is still useful.
